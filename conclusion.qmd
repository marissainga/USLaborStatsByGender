# Conclusion

The gender wage gap is a multifaceted issue that reflects a complex interplay of factors like occupation, familial responsibilities, age, race, and education. While societal and cultural norms have evolved to where feminist issues are frequently highlighted and discussed, we see deeply rooted structural inequalities persist. Our analysis of the latest BLS data shows that there are still improvements to be made, and that the story is more complex than the high-level "84 cents on the dollar" statistic.

Key takeaways from the data include:

- **Occupation**: Women continue to be over represented in lower-paying, traditionally undervalued fields, while men's earnings largely come from high powered roles in management and finance. Even within the same roles, men earn more on average than women.
- **Family responsibilities**: Married women and those with children, especially during child-rearing years, experience larger wage gaps due to caregiving demands.
- **Unpaid labor**: Women consistently take on more housework and childcare responsibilities compared to their male counterparts, limiting their earning potential.
- **Age**: The wage gap is more pronounced for women in their mid-career and later years, suggesting that ageism disproportionately affects women.
- **Race**: Race and education further exacerbate wage inequalities. While our analysis shows that Black and Hispanic women earn a higher percent earnings of Black and Hispanic men compared to White and Asian women versus their counterparts, additional analysis is needed, as Black and Hispanic womens' earnings are lower in dollar value and we suspect the wage gap calculation is distorted by by minimum wage laws.
- **Education**: while education is correlated with higher compensation across gender and race, we see that it doesn't necessarily improve the gender pay gap.

Some potential next steps include delving further into the intersectionalities of the gender pay gap, for example the interplay of ageism and race, occupation and race, and familial responsibilities and education. The gender pay gap is a complex issue that will need to be addressed with a multifaceted approach; however, this is exactly what makes it such a crucial topic for exploration: it shines a light upon the interplay of inequalities within our society. By thoroughly analyzing and addressing these systemic challenges, we can pave the way for a future where equitable pay is not just an aspiration but a reality for all.
