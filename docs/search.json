    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn discussions about wage disparity, the statistic that women make 77 cents on the dollar vs men is consistently cited. However, at such a high level, this statistic fails to address trends, facets, and stories about the underlying data. For example, how do factors like childcare, time spent doing housework, and occupation type affect the statistics? We strongly feel that the intersectionalities of (1) gender and familial responsibilities, (2) gender and occupation, and (3) gender and ethnicity have interesting (and potentially devastating) dynamics with regards to labor outcomes that are not illuminated by the simple “77 cent on the dollar” statistic. Thus for our final project, we will be exploring the effects of gender, familial status, ethnicity, and occupation types on labor outcomes, in order to unearth insights into what makes up this “77 cents on the dollar” claim. We will be using data from nationwide surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for our analysis. These surveys contain measures of interest such as the aggregate employment status of the population by sex, marital status, and presence/age of children under 18, wage and salary of women and men by major occupational groups, and earnings by gender and ethnicity.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we will draw on several key datasets from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). BLS is a federal agency that collects and disseminates various data about the U.S. economy and labor market.\nThe main dataset we will use comes out of the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a monthly survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the BLS, collecting data from approximately 60,000 eligible households across the United States. It provides detailed information on employment, earnings, demographic characteristics, and other labor market factors. Data is gathered through household interviews using a rotating panel design to ensure both consistency and coverage of the U.S. civilian noninstitutional population aged 16 and older. The CPS data includes a rich set of variables, such as employment status, wages, hours worked, and demographic factors like gender, ethnicity, and family structure (https://www.bls.gov/cps/earnings-faqs.htm#blscensus). The data we are looking at is aggregated yearly.\nWe will also use data from the the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). ATUS is a national survey conducted by BLS that collects data on how people aged 15 and older allocate their time across various activities, such as work, leisure, and household chores, through a 24-hour time diary recall to better understand patterns of time use across different demographic groups. This is also aggregated yearly at (https://www.bls.gov/tus/documents.htm)\nBoth datasets several limitations, including nonresponse bias, misclassification of employment status, and recall bias due to reliance on self-reporting. Additionally, CPS struggles with accurately capturing nontraditional employment, has limited detail on job quality, and may be affected by changes in methodology and question design over time, which complicates long-term comparisons.\nThese datasets are both available through the BLS data finder (https://www.bls.gov/data/tools.htm). We have decided to save the data from the BLS site as CSVs and import into R for this project.",

The following Cleveland dot plot helps visualize both the earnings disparity and the gender representation within each occupation. It shows the median earnings for both men and women, and how the size of the workforce differs between genders.\nThis comparison reveals that while some high-paying occupations, like management and engineering, have larger numbers of men than women, women are often clustered in lower-paying, high-population fields, such as office support and education roles.

Each point represents a different occupation, and the 45-degree line acts as the “equality line,” where men and women would be earning the same amount.\nFrom this chart, it’s clear that the majority of occupations fall below the equality line, showing that men earn more than women in most job categories.

This bar chart shows women’s median weekly earnings as a percentage of men’s earnings, broken down by marital status.\nThe data reveals that never-married women earn significantly more than their married counterparts. This may be because they do not face traditional household and caregiving demands. Divorced and widowed women also tend to earn more than married women, possibly because they have taken on greater financial independence and responsibility after major life transitions, driving them to pursue higher-paying opportunities.\nMarried women tend to experience a larger wage gap and seperated women experience the largest. One possibility for this may be family responsibilities limiting their career opportunities.

    "text": "5.2 The Impact of Children: Women’s Earnings by Parental Status\nNext, we focus on parental status and its effect on women’s wages. This bar chart compares women’s earnings as a percentage of men’s across different categories of parental status, including women with no children, women with children under 6, and women with children 6-17 years old.\nWe can see that the impact of children on women’s earnings varies across demographics when the “married spouse is present” (left plot) vs “other marital statuses” (right plot). For married couples (left plot) the trend is not too clear, with the women with children under 6 years old seeing the highest earnings parity, followed by women with no children under 18 years old and children 6 to 17. This is somewhat contrary to our initial hypothesis, which was that women with children would experience the greatest wage disparity, and women with no children under 18 years old experience the greatest to gender pay equity. This unexpected outcome may be due to confounding variables, such as age (explored further below) and maternity leave policies.\nOur hypothesis is however reflected in the “other marital statuses” (right) plot, where we see that women with no children under 18 years old make 95% of the earnings of men (the highest) and women with children 6 to 17 make 77.9% (the lowest). This suggest that the impact of children on women’s wages is most pronounced during the middle to later years of child-rearing, where children have additional extracurricular and academic activities which need to be catered to.\n\n\nCode\ndata &lt;- MedianWeeklyEarningByPresenceOfChildren |&gt;\n  filter(Characteristic != \"With children under 18 years old\")\n\nwomen_data &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(Gender == \"Women\") |&gt;\n  select(Marital_Status, Characteristic, women_median_weekly_earnings = Median_weekly_earnings)\n\nmen_data &lt;- data  |&gt;\n  filter(Gender == \"Men\")  |&gt;\n  select(Marital_Status, Characteristic, men_median_weekly_earnings = Median_weekly_earnings)\n\n# Join women and men data by Marital_Status and Characteristic\nmerged_data &lt;- left_join(women_data, men_data, by = c(\"Marital_Status\", \"Characteristic\"))\n\n# Calculate women's earnings as a percentage of men's earnings\nmerged_data &lt;- merged_data |&gt;\n  mutate(women_as_percent_of_men = (women_median_weekly_earnings / men_median_weekly_earnings) * 100)\n\n# Remove rows with missing data (if any)\nmerged_data &lt;- merged_data  |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(women_as_percent_of_men))\n\n# Reorder the 'Characteristic' factor levels to ensure the bars appear in the correct order\nmerged_data$Characteristic &lt;- factor(merged_data$Characteristic, \n                                     levels = c(\"Total\", \n                                                \"With no children under 18 years old\", \n                                                \"With children under 6 years old\", \n                                                \"With children 6 to 17 none younger\"))\n\n# Plot: Women's Earnings as a Percentage of Men's Earnings by Children Status, without legend and with simplified x-axis\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = Characteristic, y = women_as_percent_of_men, fill = Characteristic)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", show.legend = FALSE) +  # Remove legend\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(women_as_percent_of_men, 1), \"%\")), \n            vjust = 1.5, color = \"white\", fontface = \"bold\", size=3) +  # Add percentage labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Women's Median Weekly Earnings as Percentage of Men's Earnings by Children Status\",\n    x = \"Children Status\",\n    y = \"Women's Earnings as % of Men's Earnings\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) gsub(\":\", \"\\n\", x)) +  # Add line breaks in x-axis labels\n  theme_minimal() +  # Clean theme\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),  # Rotate x-axis labels for better visibility\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),  # Hide x-axis ticks\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),  # Set title size for x-axis\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),  # Set title size for y-axis\n        legend.position = \"none\",  # Ensure no legend is shown\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  facet_wrap(~ Marital_Status, scales = \"free_y\")",

    "text": "5.3 Unpaid Labor and Time Allocation: Insights from the American Time Use Survey\nOne crucial but often overlooked factor contributing to the gender wage gap is the unequal distribution of unpaid labor, particularly in the form of household chores and childcare. The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) provides valuable data on how individuals allocate their time across various activities each day. By comparing the daily schedules of men and women, we can see how these differences in time use impact their earnings.\nIn the following bar chart, we break down the average 24-hour weekday activities for both men and women. The data reveals a significant disparity in how men and women spend their time: women consistently spend more hours on unpaid tasks such as housework and childcare, while men tend to allocate more time to leisure and paid work.\nThis unequal time allocation has serious implications for the wage gap. Women’s additional hours spent on unpaid labor mean they have less time for paid work or career advancement. This imbalance in household responsibilities contributes directly to the wage disparity, as women often face more career interruptions or constraints due to their caregiving roles.\nBy highlighting the everyday time trade-offs that women make, this chart underscores the structural challenges that prevent women from fully participating in the workforce, ultimately affecting their long-term earning potential.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(grid)\n\n\n# Reshape the data into a long format\natus_long &lt;- atusAllGroups2023 |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"AnyChildren\") | starts_with(\"NoChildren\"), \n               names_to = \"Group_Gender\", values_to = \"Time\") |&gt;\n  separate(Group_Gender, into = c(\"Group\", \"Gender\"), sep = \"_\") |&gt;\n  filter(Gender %in% c(\"Men\", \"Women\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Group = factor(Group, levels = c(\"AnyChildrenUnder18\", \"NoChildren\")),\n         Gender = factor(Gender, levels = c(\"Men\", \"Women\")),\n         Major_Activity_Group = factor(Major_Activity_Group, levels = unique(Major_Activity_Group)),\n         Activity = factor(Activity, levels = unique(Activity))) |&gt;\n  # Sum the time by Major_Activity_Group for each Group and Gender\n  group_by(Major_Activity_Group, Group, Gender) |&gt;\n  summarise(Total_Time = sum(Time, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  # Normalize the total time to 24 hours\n  group_by(Group, Gender) |&gt;\n  mutate(Time = Total_Time / sum(Total_Time) * 24) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Major_Activity_Group', 'Group'.
