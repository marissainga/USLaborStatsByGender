    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn discussions about wage disparity, the statistic that women make 77 cents on the dollar vs men is consistently cited. However, at such a high level, this statistic fails to address trends, facets, and stories about the underlying data. For example, how do factors like childcare, time spent doing housework, and occupation type affect the statistics? We strongly feel that the intersectionalities of (1) gender and familial responsibilities, (2) gender and occupation, and (3) gender and ethnicity have interesting (and potentially devastating) dynamics with regards to labor outcomes that are not illuminated by the simple “77 cent on the dollar” statistic. Thus for our final project, we will be exploring the effects of gender, familial status, ethnicity, and occupation types on labor outcomes, in order to unearth insights into what makes up this “77 cents on the dollar” claim. We will be using data from nationwide surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for our analysis. These surveys contain measures of interest such as the aggregate employment status of the population by sex, marital status, and presence/age of children under 18, wage and salary of women and men by major occupational groups, and earnings by gender and ethnicity.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we will draw on several key datasets from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). BLS is a federal agency that collects and disseminates various data about the U.S. economy and labor market.\nThe main dataset we will use comes out of the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a monthly survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the BLS, collecting data from approximately 60,000 eligible households across the United States. It provides detailed information on employment, earnings, demographic characteristics, and other labor market factors. Data is gathered through household interviews using a rotating panel design to ensure both consistency and coverage of the U.S. civilian noninstitutional population aged 16 and older. The CPS data includes a rich set of variables, such as employment status, wages, hours worked, and demographic factors like gender, ethnicity, and family structure (https://www.bls.gov/cps/earnings-faqs.htm#blscensus). The data we are looking at is aggregated yearly.\nWe will also use data from the the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). ATUS is a national survey conducted by BLS that collects data on how people aged 15 and older allocate their time across various activities, such as work, leisure, and household chores, through a 24-hour time diary recall to better understand patterns of time use across different demographic groups. This is also aggregated yearly (https://www.bls.gov/tus/documents.htm)\nBoth datasets several limitations, including nonresponse bias, misclassification of employment status, and recall bias due to reliance on self-reporting. Additionally, CPS struggles with accurately capturing nontraditional employment, has limited detail on job quality, and may be affected by changes in methodology and question design over time, which complicates long-term comparisons.\nThese datasets are both available through the BLS data finder (https://www.bls.gov/data/tools.htm). We have decided to save the data from the BLS site as CSVs and import into R for this project.",
