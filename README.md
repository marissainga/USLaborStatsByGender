## US Labor Stats By Gender

*EDAV 2024 Final Project by Marissa Inga & Victoria Lin*

We were interested in exploring the gender and familial dynamics within Employment, Wage, and Labor data published by the BLS. 

### Data Sources

Our data is primarily coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

We hope to find some insights about how gender, childcare, and the intersection of the two affect employment and wage opportunities.
